# Face-Recognition-And-Registration
This is a facial recoignition system...
When a new user comes in front of the camera the system asks them to register themselves by entering their name. 
And when an already registered user comes in front of the camera the name of the user is displayed.

# Note
You may need to adjust the value of variance according to the lighting conditions of the place where the camera is set.
